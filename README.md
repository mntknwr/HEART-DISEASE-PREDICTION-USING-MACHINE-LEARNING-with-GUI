My Project entitled “Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm” goal is to determine whether or not patients have cardiac disease based on a set of characteristics provided by the patients. The goal of this research is to conserve human resources in medical facilities while also improving diagnostic accuracy. Variety of techniques is utilized to identify cardiac problems in this research, including Decision Tree, KNN, SVM and Random Forest. And among all these algorithms KNN gives the best accuracy value. Cardiovascular illnesses have become the leading cause of mortality in industrialized, developing, and underdeveloped nations during the past several decades. The mortality rate may be reduced through early diagnosis of heart disorders and physician monitoring. However, it is not feasible to properly monitor patients every day in all instances, and a doctor's 24-hour consultation is not accessible due to the time and skill required. In this project, I developed and researched models for predicting heart disease based on a patient's various heart attributes and detecting impending heart disease using machine learning techniques on a dataset that is publicly available on the Kaggle website, with the results being evaluated using a confusion matrix. Early detection of cardiovascular disease may assist in making lifestyle adjustments in high-risk individuals, reducing consequences, and even saving lives, which might be a major breakthrough in medicine.
